Project Euler
=============

"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."
(from projecteuler.net)

Project Euler is a site containing over four hundred math-based problems that are designed to be answered with the aid of language-agnostic programming. The problems are initially simple, but quickly become much more difficult. Consequently, early questions can be solved using brute force methods while later questions require a degree of inginuity and cleverness in designing the algorithm used to solve them.

Though the resulting code is not often complex in structure or content, the challenge lies within designing the most efficient solution to the problem.

A description of the problem is contained at the top of each file.

Enjoy!
